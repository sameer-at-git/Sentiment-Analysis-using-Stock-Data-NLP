## Dataset

The dataset (`stock_data.csv`) contains stock market data used for the analysis.
It includes time-series information such as **Date, Open, Close, High, Low, and Volume**.

## Jupyter Notebook

The notebook `project_notebook.ipynb` contains Python code for:

- Data loading & cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization (line plots, trends, etc.)
- Statistical summaries

## Reports

- **Report.docx** → Editable Word version of the report
- **Report.pdf** → Final PDF version of the report

These summarize the methodology, analysis, and findings.
